# Applying Drools Rule Engine in University Course Registration Efficiency


## Objective

The objective of this solution is to showcase how the Drools Rule Engine can be practically applied to improve efficiency in a university's course registration process.

## University Description

Our university is a reputable institution that offers a wide range of academic programs to students. It faces challenges related to course registration, particularly as the number of students and course offerings continue to grow.

## Operational Challenges

1. **Course Availability:** Ensuring that students can register for the courses they need to progress in their academic programs.
2. **Prerequisite Checking:** Verifying that students meet the prerequisites required for certain advanced courses.
3. **Scheduling Conflicts:** Avoiding scheduling conflicts that might prevent students from enrolling in essential courses.

## Theoretical Rules

### Course Availability Rules

- **Course Capacity Rule:** If a course's enrollment reaches its maximum capacity, close registration for that course.
- **Priority Registration Rule:** Give priority registration to graduating seniors to ensure they can enroll in their required courses.
- **Waitlist Management Rule:** If a course is full, place students on a waitlist based on their registration timestamp, and automatically enroll them if a spot becomes available.

### Prerequisite Checking Rules

- **Prerequisite Verification Rule:** Before allowing registration for an advanced course, verify that the student has completed the required prerequisites.
- **Prerequisite Advisement Rule:** If a student registers for a course without meeting prerequisites, provide advisement on the required preparatory courses.

### Scheduling Conflict Rules

- **Conflict Detection Rule:** Before finalizing a student's course schedule, check for scheduling conflicts and prompt the student to make adjustments if conflicts are found.
- **Resolution Assistance Rule:** If a scheduling conflict is detected, provide alternative course options that do not conflict with the student's existing schedule.

## Justification of Rules

- **Course Capacity Rule:** Prevents over-enrollment, ensuring a manageable student-to-faculty ratio.
- **Priority Registration Rule:** Ensures that graduating seniors get the courses they need to graduate on time.
- **Waitlist Management Rule:** Maximizes course enrollment while managing waitlisted students fairly.

- **Prerequisite Verification Rule:** Maintains academic standards by confirming students' readiness for advanced courses.
- **Prerequisite Advisement Rule:** Guides students toward completing prerequisites and making informed course choices.

- **Conflict Detection Rule:** Eliminates scheduling conflicts that can disrupt students' academic plans.
- **Resolution Assistance Rule:** Offers solutions when conflicts arise, enhancing the student experience.

# Implementing Drools Rules for University Course Registration Efficiency

## Objective

The objective of this task is to transform the theoretical Drools rules provided in the previous solution into actual code. By implementing these rules, you will gain hands-on experience in utilizing the Drools Rule Engine to improve efficiency in a university's course registration process.

## Instructions

1. **Setup Drools Environment:** Ensure that you have a working Drools environment set up. You can use Drools within your preferred programming language, such as Java or Kotlin.
    
2. **Review Theoretical Rules:** Refer to the theoretical rules provided in the previous solution for improving university course registration efficiency. These rules are structured under "Course Availability Rules," "Prerequisite Checking Rules," and "Scheduling Conflict Rules."
    
3. **Transform to Actual Drools Code:** For each of the theoretical rules, write the corresponding Drools rule in your chosen programming language. Implement each rule with the following components:
    
    - **Rule Name:** A unique identifier for each rule.
    - **When (LHS):** The condition(s) part of the rule. Define the criteria that must be met for the rule to execute.
    - **Then (RHS):** The actions part of the rule. Specify what actions should be taken when the conditions are met.
    - **End:** Ensure that each rule is appropriately concluded.
4. **Compile and Test:** Compile your code and test the rules using sample data or scenarios. Ensure that the rules behave as expected and address the operational challenges mentioned in the solution.
    
5. **Document Your Code:** Create documentation that includes:
    
    - A list of all transformed Drools rules.
    - A clear explanation of each rule, including its Rule Name, LHS (conditions), RHS (actions), and any assumptions or explanations needed.
    - Sample input data or scenarios used for testing.
6. **Justify Your Choices:** Provide a brief explanation for each rule's structure and logic. Discuss why you structured each rule in the way you did and how it addresses the specific challenges.
    

## Submission

Submit your implementation of the Drools rules, along with the documentation, for review. Ensure that your code is well-documented, and your explanations are clear and concise.

## Learning Outcome

This task offers practical experience in converting theoretical rules into functional Drools rules, demonstrating the real-world application of the Drools Rule Engine in university course registration efficiency.

Here are hints and an actual example for implementing Drools rules along with code samples in Java. These examples cover a simplified scenario of course registration, focusing on the "Course Availability Rules."

### Hints:

1. **Setup Drools Environment:**
    
    - You can set up a Drools project using Maven or Gradle for easier dependency management.
    - Ensure you have the Drools libraries and runtime integrated into your project.
2. **Transform Theoretical Rules:**
    
    - For each rule, define the conditions (LHS) using Drools' DSL (Domain Specific Language).
    - Specify the actions (RHS) that should be taken when the conditions are met.
    - Use Drools' syntax to express your rules, keeping them clear and concise.
    - Don't forget to provide a unique name for each rule.
3. **Compile and Test:**
    
    - Create sample data or scenarios to test your rules.
    - Ensure your rules are triggered correctly and produce the expected outcomes.
4. **Document Your Code:**
    
    - Create clear documentation that explains each rule in detail.
    - Include comments in your code to make it more understandable.
5. **Justify Your Choices:**
    
    - Explain why you structured each rule in a particular way.
    - Discuss how each rule addresses the specific challenges mentioned.

### Example - Course Capacity Rule:

**Theoretical Rule:**

- "If a course's enrollment reaches its maximum capacity, close registration for that course."

**Drools Code in Java:**

``` java

`import org.drools.core.spi.KnowledgeHelper;  rule "Course Capacity Rule" when     $course : Course(enrollment >= maxCapacity) then     // Close registration for the course     $course.setRegistrationClosed(true);     System.out.println("Registration for course " + $course.getName() + " is closed due to maximum capacity reached."); end`
```

In this Java example, we define the "Course Capacity Rule" using Drools syntax. It checks if the enrollment for a course is greater than or equal to its maximum capacity. If the condition is met, it sets the `registrationClosed` flag to true and prints a message indicating that registration is closed for that course.

---

> [!NOTE]
> Delegates should follow a similar approach to implement the remaining rules, adapt them to their specific use case, and test their behavior using sample data.

---


Let's make the code more complex by adding additional conditions and actions to the Drools rules. In this example, we'll expand on the "Course Capacity Rule" and introduce a new rule, the "Priority Registration Rule."

### Complex Example - Course Capacity Rule with Priority Registration:

**Theoretical Rules:**

1. **Course Capacity Rule:**
    - "If a course's enrollment reaches its maximum capacity, close registration for that course."
2. **Priority Registration Rule:**
    - "Give priority registration to graduating seniors to ensure they can enroll in their required courses."

**Drools Code in Java:**

``` java

`import org.drools.core.spi.KnowledgeHelper;  rule "Course Capacity Rule" when     $course : Course(enrollment >= maxCapacity, registrationClosed == false) then     // Close registration for the course     $course.setRegistrationClosed(true);     System.out.println("Registration for course " + $course.getName() + " is closed due to maximum capacity reached."); end  rule "Priority Registration Rule" when     $student : Student(graduationYear == 2024) // Assuming 2024 represents graduating seniors     $course : Course(priorityRegistration == true, registrationClosed == false) then     // Allow priority registration for graduating seniors     $student.setRegistered(true);     System.out.println("Priority registration granted to student " + $student.getName() + "."); end`
```

In this more complex example, we have two rules:

1. **Course Capacity Rule:** This rule checks if a course's enrollment has reached its maximum capacity and if registration for the course is still open. If both conditions are met, it closes the registration for that course.
    
2. **Priority Registration Rule:** This rule grants priority registration to graduating seniors (assuming a graduation year of 2024) for courses that allow priority registration and still have open registration. It sets the `registered` flag for the student to true and prints a message indicating priority registration has been granted.
