![University Banner](https://example.com/university-banner.png) <!-- Replace with your university banner image -->

## Objective

The objective of this solution is to showcase how the Drools Rule Engine can be practically applied to improve efficiency in a university's course registration process.

## University Description

Our university is a reputable institution that offers a wide range of academic programs to students. It faces challenges related to course registration, particularly as the number of students and course offerings continue to grow.

## Operational Challenges

1. **Course Availability:** Ensuring that students can register for the courses they need to progress in their academic programs.
2. **Prerequisite Checking:** Verifying that students meet the prerequisites required for certain advanced courses.
3. **Scheduling Conflicts:** Avoiding scheduling conflicts that might prevent students from enrolling in essential courses.

## Theoretical Rules

### Course Availability Rules

- **Course Capacity Rule:** If a course's enrollment reaches its maximum capacity, close registration for that course.
- **Priority Registration Rule:** Give priority registration to graduating seniors to ensure they can enroll in their required courses.
- **Waitlist Management Rule:** If a course is full, place students on a waitlist based on their registration timestamp, and automatically enroll them if a spot becomes available.

### Prerequisite Checking Rules

- **Prerequisite Verification Rule:** Before allowing registration for an advanced course, verify that the student has completed the required prerequisites.
- **Prerequisite Advisement Rule:** If a student registers for a course without meeting prerequisites, provide advisement on the required preparatory courses.

### Scheduling Conflict Rules

- **Conflict Detection Rule:** Before finalizing a student's course schedule, check for scheduling conflicts and prompt the student to make adjustments if conflicts are found.
- **Resolution Assistance Rule:** If a scheduling conflict is detected, provide alternative course options that do not conflict with the student's existing schedule.

## Justification of Rules

- **Course Capacity Rule:** Prevents over-enrollment, ensuring a manageable student-to-faculty ratio.
- **Priority Registration Rule:** Ensures that graduating seniors get the courses they need to graduate on time.
- **Waitlist Management Rule:** Maximizes course enrollment while managing waitlisted students fairly.

- **Prerequisite Verification Rule:** Maintains academic standards by confirming students' readiness for advanced courses.
- **Prerequisite Advisement Rule:** Guides students toward completing prerequisites and making informed course choices.

- **Conflict Detection Rule:** Eliminates scheduling conflicts that can disrupt students' academic plans.
- **Resolution Assistance Rule:** Offers solutions when conflicts arise, enhancing the student experience.

## Presentation

The findings and rules have been compiled into a structured document, demonstrating how Drools can improve operational efficiency, student satisfaction, and decision-making in a university's course registration process.

## Learning Outcome

This exercise highlights the practical application of Drools in addressing real-world operational challenges within a university. It underscores the role of automation and rule-based decision-making in enhancing efficiency and student success in the context of course registration.
