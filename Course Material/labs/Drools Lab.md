This structured exercise will help delegates apply Drools Rules Engine to a practical problem, reinforcing their understanding of rule-based systems and their applications in real-world scenarios.

**Provided steps and Drools rules for processing loan applications.**

For the Loan Application use case in the Drools rules engine, we'll design a scenario where the system evaluates loan applications based on the applicant's credit score, income, and requested loan amount. The rules will determine whether the application is approved, and if so, at what interest rate.

**Let's plan this out:**

1. **Input**: The system takes in details of the loan application, including applicant's name, credit score, annual income, and the amount requested for the loan.

2. **Rules**: 
   - Rule 1: Check if the credit score is above a certain threshold for eligibility.
   - Rule 2: Assess the risk based on the income and requested loan amount ratio.
   - Rule 3: Determine the interest rate based on the risk level.

3. **Output**: The system outputs the decision on the loan application (Approved or Denied) and, if approved, specifies the interest rate.

### Directory Structure
For the loan application processing use case with Drools, the directory structure of the project can be organized as follows to ensure a clean separation of concerns and ease of navigation:

```
LoanApplicationProcessor/
│
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   ├── com/
│   │   │   │   └── yourcompany/

```

### Key Components:

- **`controller/`**: This directory contains REST controllers that expose endpoints to accept loan applications, process them, and return decisions.

- **`service/`**: The service layer is responsible for the business logic, including initializing Drools sessions, applying rules to loan applications, and interpreting the results.

- **`model/`**: Here, you define your domain models such as `LoanApplication`, which includes properties like `creditScore`, `annualIncome`, `loanAmount`, and `approvalStatus`.

- **`config/`**: Configuration classes, including the setup for Drools (`KieSession`, `KieContainer`, etc.), database configurations, and any other Spring Boot configurations.

- **`resources/drools/`**: This folder contains the `.drl` files where you define your Drools rules. These rules are applied to loan applications to determine approval status and other decisions.

- **`test/`**: Contains unit and integration tests for your application, ensuring that your controllers, services, and Drools rules work as expected.

- **`pom.xml`**: Maven configuration file for managing project dependencies, plugins, and other configurations.

- **`README.md`**: A markdown file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, how to run the application, and any other relevant information for users and contributors.

> This structure provides a solid foundation for developing a loan application processing system using Drools within a Spring Boot application, ensuring modularity, ease of maintenance, and scalability.


### Drools Rules Example (`LoanRules.drl`)

```drools
package com.yourcompany.loanapplication.rules

import com.yourcompany.loanapplication.model.LoanApplication

// Rule for checking credit score eligibility
rule "Check Credit Score Eligibility"
when
    LoanApplication(creditScore < 650)
then
    System.out.println("Loan Application Denied: Credit score too low.");
    application.setApproved(false);
end

// Rule for assessing loan amount based on annual income
rule "Assess Loan to Income Ratio"
when
    $application: LoanApplication(loanAmount / annualIncome > 0.5)
then
    System.out.println("Loan Application Denied: Loan to income ratio too high.");
    $application.setApproved(false);
end

// Rule for determining interest rate
rule "Determine Interest Rate"
when
    $application: LoanApplication(approved == true, creditScore >= 650 && creditScore < 750)
then
    System.out.println("Loan Application Approved: Standard Interest Rate Applied.");
    $application.setInterestRate(5.0);  // Standard interest rate
end

rule "Determine Interest Rate for High Credit Score"
when
    $application: LoanApplication(approved == true, creditScore >= 750)
then
    System.out.println("Loan Application Approved: Reduced Interest Rate Applied.");
    $application.setInterestRate(3.5);  // Reduced interest rate for high credit scores
end
```

This setup includes rules for eligibility based on credit score, a check against high loan-to-income ratios, and setting interest rates based on creditworthiness. Each rule modifies the `LoanApplication` object, setting its `approved` status and `interestRate` as needed.

To proceed with coding, let's start with defining the `LoanApplication` model and the basic structure for the Drools configuration within the Spring Boot application. 

## LoanApplication Model

Let's start with defining the `LoanApplication` model. This Java class will hold the details of each loan application, including the applicant's credit score, annual income, loan amount requested, and the fields that will be set by our Drools rules, such as approval status and interest rate.

### Step 1: Define the LoanApplication Model

```java
package com.yourcompany.loanapplication.model;

public class LoanApplication {
    private String applicantName;
    private int creditScore;
    private double annualIncome;
    private double loanAmount;
    private boolean approved;
    private double interestRate;

    // Constructors, Getters, and Setters

    public LoanApplication() {
    }

    public LoanApplication(String applicantName, int creditScore, double annualIncome, double loanAmount) {
        this.applicantName = applicantName;
        this.creditScore = creditScore;
        this.annualIncome = annualIncome;
        this.loanAmount = loanAmount;
        this.approved = false; // Default value
        this.interestRate = 0.0; // Default value
    }

    // Getters and setters for all fields
}
```

### Step 2: Configure Drools within Spring Boot

Next, we'll set up the Drools configuration in our Spring Boot application. This involves creating a `KieContainer` bean that will be responsible for containing our knowledge base, including all our Drools rules.

```java
package com.yourcompany.loanapplication.config;

import org.kie.api.KieServices;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class DroolsConfig {

    @Bean
    public KieContainer kieContainer() {
        return KieServices.Factory.get().getKieClasspathContainer();
    }
}
```

This configuration assumes that the Drools rule files (`*.drl`) are placed under `src/main/resources` in the appropriate package directory, which matches the package declared in the `.drl` files.

### Step 3: Create a Service to Apply Rules

Now, we'll create a service that applies our Drools rules to a given `LoanApplication` instance.

```java
package com.yourcompany.loanapplication.service;

import com.yourcompany.loanapplication.model.LoanApplication;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer;
import org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class LoanApplicationService {

    private final KieContainer kieContainer;

    @Autowired
    public LoanApplicationService(KieContainer kieContainer) {
        this.kieContainer = kieContainer;
    }

    public LoanApplication applyRules(LoanApplication application) {
        KieSession kieSession = kieContainer.newKieSession();
        kieSession.insert(application);
        kieSession.fireAllRules();
        kieSession.dispose();
        return application;
    }
}
```

This service injects the `KieContainer`, creates a new `KieSession` for each application, inserts the `LoanApplication` object into the session, and fires all rules. The `LoanApplication` object is then returned with the fields modified by the rules (e.g., `approved`, `interestRate`).

### Next Steps

- Implement a REST controller to accept loan applications and use the `LoanApplicationService` to process them.
- Add exception handling and validation to ensure that the application data is valid before processing.
- Write unit tests to cover various scenarios and rule outcomes.

This provides a solid foundation for your Drools-based loan application processing system. If you need further assistance with any of these components or additional functionalities, feel free to ask! 😄
### Case 3: Custom Scenario
- Introduce a new use case relevant to your domain and outline the Drools rules and steps involved.
