## 1. Loan Processing Rules

### Overview

This lab focuses on the implementation of Drools rules for a loan processing system, considering factors such as debt, annual salary, and credit score.

### Lab Exercises

#### Rule Implementation

1. **Debt-to-Loan Ratio Rule:**
   - Develop a rule to compare the requested loan amount with the applicant's existing debt. If the loan amount is more than twice the existing debt, the application should be rejected.
2. **Annual Salary Rule:**
   - Implement a rule to check the applicant's annual salary. If the salary is $50,000 or less, the application should be rejected.
3. **Credit Score-Based Rate Assignment:**
   - Create a rule to assign loan rates based on the applicant's credit score. This rule is only applied if the applicant passes the first two checks.

#### Test Scenarios

1. **High Debt Scenario:**
   - Test an application where the requested loan amount is significantly higher than the existing debt.
2. **Low Salary Scenario:**
   - Test an application with an applicant having an annual salary below the threshold.
3. **Qualified Applicant Scenario:**
   - Test an application where the applicant meets the debt and salary criteria, and assess how the loan rate is assigned based on their credit score.

### Expected Output

- **High Debt Scenario:** A rejection message indicating the loan amount is too high compared to existing debt.
- **Low Salary Scenario:** A rejection message due to the applicant's salary being below the threshold.
- **Qualified Applicant Scenario:** Display the assigned loan rate based on the applicant's credit score.

### Additional Scenarios

1. **Multiple Loans Scenario:** Assess how the system handles applicants with multiple existing debts.
2. **Borderline Salary Scenario:** Evaluate applications where the salary is just above or just below the threshold.
3. **Varying Credit Scores:** Test how different credit scores affect the assigned loan rates.

### Guidance for Next Steps:

1. **Develop and Test Rules:** Code each rule in Drools, making sure they accurately reflect the loan assessment criteria.
2. **Create Comprehensive Test Cases:** Design test cases that cover a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the robustness of your rules.
3. **Analyze and Refine:** After testing, analyze the outcomes for accuracy and refine the rules as necessary to ensure they align with the intended loan processing criteria.

This lab will provide a thorough understanding of rule-based systems in financial contexts and the versatility of Drools in handling complex decision-making processes.

## 2. Life Insurance Calculation

### Overview

This lab focuses on building a comprehensive rule set in Drools for calculating life insurance premiums. The calculation considers various factors such as age, health condition, lifestyle factors, and additional risk elements.

### Lab Exercises

#### Premium Calculation Rules

- Develop rules for calculating base insurance premiums based on age brackets (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.).
- Implement additional rules to factor in health conditions like diabetes, heart disease, etc., which increase the premium rate.
- Create rules to adjust premiums for lifestyle factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and high-risk hobbies like skydiving.
- Include rules for family medical history, considering hereditary health risks.

#### Risk Assessment Rules

- Develop rules to assess overall risk based on a combination of age, health, and lifestyle factors.
- Create a rule to classify the insurance policy into different risk categories (e.g., low, medium, high).

#### Scenario Testing

- Test these rules with various customer profiles, simulating different combinations of age, health conditions, lifestyle choices, and family history.
- Validate the accuracy of premium calculations and risk assessments for each scenario.

### Expected Output

- **For each age bracket:** Display the base premium rate.
- **Considering health conditions:** Show increased premium rates.
- **Accounting for lifestyle factors:** Adjust the premium rate accordingly.
- **With family medical history:** Further adjust the premium.
- **Overall risk category:** Display the risk category based on the combined factors.

### Additional Scenarios

1. **Young Individuals with High-Risk Hobbies:** Analyze how premiums adjust for younger customers engaged in high-risk activities.
2. **Older Individuals with Good Health and Lifestyle:** Evaluate premium adjustments for older customers maintaining excellent health and low-risk lifestyles.
3. **Individuals with a Family History of Chronic Diseases:** Observe premium changes for customers with hereditary health risks.

### Guidance for Next Steps:

1. **Implement Detailed Rules:** Focus on coding each rule in Drools, ensuring they cover all outlined factors.
2. **Test with Diverse Profiles:** Create a range of customer profiles to thoroughly test each scenario and rule.
3. **Analyze Outcomes:** After each test, analyze the outcomes to validate the effectiveness of your rules and adjust as necessary.

By expanding these exercises, you'll gain deeper insights into the complexities of insurance premium calculations and the power of Drools in handling multifaceted decision-making processes.

## 3. Commodities and Futures Contracts Rules

### Overview

This lab is designed to explore the implementation of rules in Drools for managing the complexities of commodities and futures contracts. The focus will be on ensuring contract validity and compliance with regulatory standards.

### Lab Exercises

#### Contract Validation Rules

1. **Terms and Conditions Check:**
   - Develop rules to validate the key terms of the contracts, such as contract duration, commodity type, quantity, and price.
2. **Counterparty Eligibility:**
   - Implement rules to verify the eligibility of counterparties based on factors like creditworthiness and market reputation.

#### Compliance Check

1. **Regulatory Standards Adherence:**
   - Create rules to ensure that each contract adheres to relevant financial regulations, such as market manipulation laws and trading limits.
2. **Reporting Requirements:**
   - Develop rules for compliance with mandatory reporting requirements, ensuring timely and accurate disclosure of contract details.

#### Scenario Testing

1. **Standard Contract Scenario:**
   - Test a standard futures contract to validate its terms and regulatory compliance.
2. **High-Risk Counterparty Scenario:**
   - Evaluate contracts involving high-risk counterparties to assess the robustness of eligibility checks.
3. **Regulatory Breach Scenario:**
   - Test contracts that potentially breach regulatory standards to see if the system accurately identifies non-compliance.

### Expected Output

- **Standard Contract Scenario:** A confirmation message stating the contract is valid and compliant.
- **High-Risk Counterparty Scenario:** A warning or rejection message based on the counterparty's risk level.
- **Regulatory Breach Scenario:** An alert indicating the specific area of non-compliance in the contract.

### Additional Scenarios

1. **Multiple Commodities Scenario:** Test contracts involving various types of commodities to assess the flexibility of validation rules.
2. **Cross-Border Contracts:** Evaluate contracts with international elements to check compliance with diverse regulatory environments.
3. **Market Volatility Scenario:** Analyze contracts created during periods of high market volatility to ensure they remain compliant under changing conditions.
