## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
Before diving into the lab, make sure your development environment is set up with the necessary tools. Follow these steps to prepare:

### 1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK) 17
The JDK is essential for developing Java applications.

- **Download**: Visit the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or any other preferred provider and download JDK 17.
- **Install**: Execute the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
- **Configure Environment Variables**: Set `JAVA_HOME` to your JDK installation path and update the `PATH` variable to include `$JAVA_HOME/bin`.

### 2. Set Up IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ IDEA is a powerful Java IDE that supports a variety of programming languages.

- **Download**: Go to the [JetBrains website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to download IntelliJ IDEA.
- **Install**: Run the installer and follow the instructions to install IntelliJ on your machine.
- **Configure**: Open IntelliJ IDEA and configure it to use JDK 17 for your projects.

### 3. Install Maven
Maven is a build and dependency management tool for Java.

- **Download**: Navigate to the [Apache Maven project website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) to download Maven.
- **Install**: Unzip the distribution archive to the directory of your choice.
- **Configure Environment Variables**: Add the `bin` directory from the Maven installation to the `PATH` variable.

### 4. Install Docker
Docker allows you to containerize your applications, making them easy to deploy and run.

- **Download**: Visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and choose Docker Desktop for your operating system.
- **Install**: Open the installer and complete the setup process.
- **Verify Installation**: Run `docker --version` to confirm that Docker is installed correctly.

### 5. Install Docker Compose
Docker Compose is used for running multi-container Docker applications.

- **Installation**: Docker Compose comes installed with Docker Desktop for Windows and Mac. For Linux, follow the instructions on the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- **Verify Installation**: Execute `docker-compose --version` to ensure it's installed successfully.

After you have installed all the tools, you can proceed with setting up your Drools project environment.
